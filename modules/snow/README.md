Snow Plugin
===========

This just creates snow in the background of your Magic Mirror 2 installation.

Pretty easy to install:

1. Fork the repo on GitHub (I have 2-factor enabled).
2. Clone that repo into your modules folder.
3. Add it to your installation. It's called `snow`. Also: it has no configuration.
